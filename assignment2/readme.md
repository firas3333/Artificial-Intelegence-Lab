code to solve the puzzle game RushHour using:


reinforcment learning algorithm:
we save the optimal moves from the A* algorithm and all the possible moves then we run the reinforcment learning algorithm

A* :
hueristics : red car can destroy cars , only count the cars directly blocking the red car
 
bidirectional A* :
using the solutions and the hueristic we got from first assignment
